# LookAround-2

LookAround-2 is a demo project I am building just for learning AngularJS 2. Earlier I built LookAround application for learning AngularJS. LookAround-2 will have the same features of LookAround project, except this time I am going to use material design for the UI. 

We are going to build each components in TDD approach. 

Tools of Trade:

- AngularJS 2
- Material Design ( if possible )
- Gulp for building
- Traceur for ES6 transpiling
