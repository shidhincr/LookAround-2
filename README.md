# LookAround-2

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/shidhincr/LookAround-2.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

LookAround-2 is a demo project I am building just for learning AngularJS 2. Earlier I built LookAround application for learning AngularJS. LookAround-2 will have the same features of LookAround project, except this time I am going to use material design for the UI. 

We are going to build each components in TDD approach. 

Tools of Trade:

- AngularJS 2
- TypeScript
- Material Design ( if possible )
- Traceur for ES6 transpiling
- System.js for loading modules
